# Native API migration notes

## M126: unknown request fields are errors

Write/query request roots, document envelopes, and multi-query children reject unknown
keys with HTTP 400 and `error.code: "bad_request"`. The error message names the field.
Previously these envelopes could ignore an extra key, so an unsupported option or typo
could appear to succeed. Existing strict nested options keep their rejection behavior.

Remove unsupported options or correct the named key before retrying. For example,
`durabilty` is an error; the supported field is `durability`, with `"batched"` or
`"durable"`. Vendor-only options such as `return_affected_ids`, `disable_backpressure`,
`compute_attributes`, and `limit` are not accepted by this native API version.
Use `top_k` to set the native query result limit.
Use the [comparison](comparisons/turbopuffer-2026-10-25.md) for the pinned capability gaps
and [delivery status](comparisons/DELIVERY.md) for work in progress.

User data maps remain open. Attribute names under `attributes`, named vector fields,
patch columns, and aggregate labels do not become reserved merely because they resemble
request option names. Known duplicate keys retain the existing last-value behavior.

Invalid requests are validated before engine access and cannot partially buffer or
flush their valid rows. No stored-data migration is needed. Native write/read defaults
remain batched/eventual; this change does not add authentication or change mutation
completion guarantees. The [M126 verification ledger](milestones/M126/VERIFIED.md)
records the evidence and any checks still pending.
